\makesubproblem{}{convex-optimization:problemSet1:7a}
Prove that the set \( \calS \) resulting from taking the intersection of a set of convex sets \( \calS_\alpha \) is itself a convex set.
I.e., \( \calS = \cap_\alpha \calS_\alpha \) is a convex set when all the \( \calS_\alpha \) are convex sets.

\makesubproblem{}{convex-optimization:problemSet1:7b}
Consider any affine function \( f : \Rm{n} \rightarrow \Rm{m} \) and convex set \( \calS \subseteq \Rm{n}\).
Prove that the image of \( \calS \) under \( f \), i.e., \( f(\calS) = \setlr{f(x)| x \in \calS}\), is a convex set.

\makesubproblem{}{convex-optimization:problemSet1:7c}
Consider any affine function \( f : \Rm{n} \rightarrow \Rm{m} \) and convex set \( \calS \subseteq \Rm{m} \).
Prove that the inverse (or pre-) image of \( \calS \) under \(f\), i.e., \( f^{-1}(\calS) = \setlr{x|f(x) \in \calS}\), is a convex set.
