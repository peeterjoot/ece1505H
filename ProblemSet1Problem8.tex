\citep{boyd2004convex} pr. 2.14(a)}{
Let \( S \subseteq \bbR^n \), and let \( \Norm{ \cdot } \) be a norm on \R{n}.

For \( a \ge 0 \) we define \( S_a \) as \( \setlr{ \Bx | \dist(\Bx, S) \le a } \), where \( \dist(\Bx, S) = \inf_{\By \in S} \Norm{ \Bx - \By }\).  We refer to \( S_a \) as \( S \) expanded or extended by \( a \).  Show that if \( S \) is convex, then \( S_a \) is convex.

The geometry of this set extension is sketched in \cref{fig:ps1p8:ps1p8Fig1}.

The sphere of radius \( a \) centered on a point \( \By \in S \), as sketched in \cref{fig:ps1p8:ps1p8Fig2}, is

\imageFigure{../figures/ece1505-convex-optimization/ps1p8Fig2}{Sphere of radius \( a \).}{fig:ps1p8:ps1p8Fig2}{0.2}

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ProblemSet1Problem8:20}
\setlr{ \By + \theta a \rcap},
\end{dmath}

where \( \theta \in [0,1] \) and \( \rcap \) is a unit vector directed outwards from \( \By \).  If \( \Bx \) is a point on the exterior of that sphere, the set of points in the sphere can be written

\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:ProblemSet1Problem8:40}
\setlr{ \By + \theta a \rcap}
=
\setlr{ \By + \theta a \frac{\Bx - \By}{\Norm{\Bx - \By}} }
=
\setlr{ \By + \theta (\Bx - \By) }
=
\setlr{ \theta \Bx + (1-\theta) \By }.
\end{dmath}

The union of such spheres, over all \( \By \in S \), is precisely the set \( S_a \), seen to be the convex combinations of points \( \Bx \in S_a, \By \in S \), or \( \Bx, \By \in S \).
