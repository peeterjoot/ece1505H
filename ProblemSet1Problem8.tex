\citep{boyd2004convex} pr. 2.14(a)}{
Let \( S \subseteq \bbR^n \), and let \( \Norm{ \cdot } \) be a norm on \R{n}.

For \( a \ge 0 \) we define \( S_a \) as \( \setlr{ \Bx | \dist(\Bx, S) \le a } \), where \( \dist(\Bx, S) = \inf_{\By \in S} \Norm{ \Bx - \By }\).  We refer to \( S_a \) as \( S \) expanded or extended by \( a \).  Show that if \( S \) is convex, then \( S_a \) is convex.
