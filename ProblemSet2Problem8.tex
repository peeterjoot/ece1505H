\makeproblem{Examples of proving convexity}{convexOptimization:problemSet2:8}{
\makesubproblem{}{convexOptimization:problemSet2:8a}
Show that the following function \( f : \bbR^n \rightarrow \bbR \) is convex where

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ProblemSet2Problem8:20}
f(\Bx) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
-(x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n)^{1/n} & \quad \mbox{if \( x_1 > 0, \cdots, x_n > 0\)} \\
\infty & \quad \mbox{\( otherwise\)}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

Prove the above result by computing the Hessian of the function. (Note, this is a special
case of
\citep{boyd2004convex} pr. 3.18(b) in which you are asked to show that
\( (\det X)^{1/n} \)
is concave on
\(\dom f = S^n_{++} \).
While
for this problem I ask you to compute the Hessian, in that problem you
may take any approach you wish.)

\paragraph{Hint:} it may prove useful to use the relation that for any real numbers \( \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_n\), \( (\sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i)^2 \le n (\sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i^2) \).

Show that the following function \( f : \bbR^n \rightarrow \bbR \) is convex where

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ProblemSet2Problem8:40}
f(\Bx) = \exp\lr{ \beta \Bx^\T A \Bx },
\end{equation}

where \( \Bx \in \bbR^n \), \( A \) is a positive semidefinite symmetric \( n \times n \) matrix, and \( \beta \) is a positive scalar.
