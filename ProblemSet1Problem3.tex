\makeproblem{Matrix inner product}{convex-optimization:problemSet1:3}{
\makesubproblem{}{convex-optimization:problemSet1:3a}
Verify that \( \calS^n \subseteq \Rm{n \times n} \) is a vector space under the regular matrix addition and scaling (multiplication by scalars in \(\bbR\)) operations.
Accomplish this by verifying that all properties of a vector space are satisfied.

\makesubproblem{}{convex-optimization:problemSet1:3b}
Verify that \( \innerproduct{A}{B} = \Tr(A^\T B) \) where \( A, B \in \calS^n \) satisfies all the properties of an inner product.
