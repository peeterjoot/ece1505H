\makeoproblem{Convex-concave functions and saddle-points}{convexOptimization:problemSet2:3}{\citep{boyd2004convex} pr. 3.14}{
We way the function \( f : \bbR^n \times \bbR^m \rightarrow \bbR \) is convex-concave if \( f(\Bx,\Bz) \) is a concave function of \( \Bz \), for each fixed \( \Bx\), and a convex function of \( \Bx \), for each fixed \(\Bz\).  We also require its domain to have the product form \( \dom f = A \times B \), where \( A \subseteq \bbR^n \) and \( B \subseteq \bbR^m \) are convex.
\makesubproblem{}{convexOptimization:problemSet2:3a}
Give a second-order condition for a twice differentable function \( f : \bbR^n \times \bbR^m \rightarrow \bbR \) to be convex-concave, in terms of its Hessian \( \spacegrad^2 f(\Bx,\Bz) \).
\makesubproblem{}{convexOptimization:problemSet2:3b}
Suppose that \( f : \bbR^n \times \bbR^m \rightarrow \bbR \) is a convex-concave and differentiable, with \( \spacegrad f(\tilde{\Bx}, \tilde{\Bz}) = 0\).  Show that the saddle-point property holds: for all \( \Bx, \Bz\), we have

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ProblemSet2Problem3:20}
f(\tilde{\Bx}, \Bz)  \le f(\tilde{\Bx}, \tilde{\Bz})  \le f(\Bx, \tilde{\Bz}) .
\end{equation}

Show that this implies that \( f \) satisfies the strong max-in property:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ProblemSet2Problem3:40}
\sup_\Bz \inf_\Bx f(\Bx, \Bz) = \inf_\Bx \sup_\Bz f(\Bx,\Bz)
\end{equation}

(and their common value is \( f(\tilde{\Bx}, \tilde{\Bz}) \)).

\makesubproblem{}{convexOptimization:problemSet2:3c}
Now suppose that \( f : \bbR^n \times \bbR^m \rightarrow \bbR \) is differentiable, but not necessarily convex-concave, and the saddle-point property holds at \( \tilde{\Bx}, \tilde{\Bz}\):

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ProblemSet2Problem3:60}
f(\tilde{\Bx}, \Bz)  \le f(\tilde{\Bx}, \tilde{\Bz})  \le f(\Bx, \tilde{\Bz}),
\end{equation}

for all \( \Bx, \Bz\).  Show that \( \spacegrad  f(\tilde{\Bx}, \tilde{\Bz}) = 0\).
